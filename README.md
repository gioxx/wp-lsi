# Lightweight Social Icons Mod 1.1.1

Given that the development of this excellent plugin has been stagnant for two years (see https://wordpress.org/plugins/lightweight-social-icons/), I revisited it to generate a more updated version of Fontello (the font included in the plugin) to include Mastodon and Telegram, and took the opportunity to remove Google+ (since it no longer exists).

You will simply need to replace the original plugin files in your WordPress installation (via FTP) to not lose any configuration. You can then add the new Social Networks introduced.

For requests for new icons, you can open an Issue. Inside the "asset" folder, I have also included the json configuration file that you can upload to Fontello to take a look at the hex codes of the icons / modify them / add more / etc.

If you have any doubts, contact me.
